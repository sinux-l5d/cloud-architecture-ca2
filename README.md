This is the code for the second CA of Cloud Computing in DkIT.

Aims can be found in `aim.txt`, but the main idea is to discover 2 services by ourselves and use them in a simple cloud-native application powered by a Lex (v2) chatbot.

I've choosed to play with Step Functions and Simple Email Service (SES) from AWS, along the mendatory Lex and the previously used Lambda & DynamoDB.
